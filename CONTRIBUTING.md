## Architecture Overview

- **`bin/cli.js`**: Universal Node.js CLI runtime, HTTP server, SSE live-reload hub, and export engine.
- **`bin/dotmd.exe`**: Native Windows GUI launcher compiled via `scripts/build-launcher.ps1` to suppress console windows.
- **`lib/template.js`**: Core HTML/CSS template compiler, client-side GFM parser, typography, and interactive components.
- **`lib/platform-installer.js`**: Native OS desktop integration (Windows Registry, macOS LaunchServices, Linux Freedesktop).
- **`scripts/generate-shell.js`**: Pre-compiles `template.html` and `dist/index.html` from `lib/template.js`.
